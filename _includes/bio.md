Biography
</h2>

Hi, I am Jiancheng Pan (<span style="font-family: 'Ma Shan Zheng', cursive;">潘建成</span>). I am a third-year master student at the Institute of Computer Vision of Zhejiang University of Technology under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XGZ4UZgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Cong Bai</a>. At the same time, I am a visiting research student at <a href="https://github.com/AI4EarthLab">AI4Earth Laboratory</a>  of Tsinghua University with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yH9OkqYAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Xiaomeng Huang</a> (The learning here has led me to attempt interdisciplinary research combining AI and geosciences). Honorably, I will be research internship at <a href="https://insait.ai/">Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology </a> (INSAIT, Sofia, Bulgaria), working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Luc Van Gool</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=W43pvPkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Danda Paudel</a>.
<!-- Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Jiangxi Normal University in 2022, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZO3KGykAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Aiwen Jiang</a>. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->
**My research interests** [**Keywords**] include but are not limited to Multimodal Learning, Data-centric AI, Foundation Model with its application on Earth Observation [**GeoAI**], towards constructing Earth Observation Foundation Models and Multi-modal LLMs for Earth Observation. I am also dedicated to tackling challenges in Earth sciences through machine learning, with a particular emphasis on solving socially relevant problems, such as advancing sustainability [**ML4Sustainability**][**AI4Earth**].
<!-- - **AI4EO**: Multimodal Learning, Data-centric AI, Foundation Model -->
<!-- - **AI4Earth**: ML4Sustainability -->

I believe in *<u>earning through skills and achieving through collaboration</u>*. <font color="#3eb7f0">I am actively seeking internship or co-operation opportunities related to tackling challenges the field of Earth sciences with GeoAI technologies, particularly in sustainable development.</font> If you are also similarly working on related research, feel free to discuss and communicate with me.
