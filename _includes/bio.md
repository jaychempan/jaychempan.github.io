About Me
</h2>

Hi, I am Jiancheng Pan (<span style="font-family: 'Ma Shan Zheng', cursive;">潘建成</span>). I am a third-year master student at the Institute of Computer Vision of Zhejiang University of Technology under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XGZ4UZgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Cong Bai</a>. At the same time, I am a visiting research student at <a href="https://github.com/AI4EarthLab">AI4Earth Laboratory</a>  of Tsinghua University with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yH9OkqYAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Xiaomeng Huang</a>. Honorably, I will be a visting researcher at <a href="https://insait.ai/">Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology </a> (INSAIT, Sofia, Bulgaria), working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Luc Van Gool</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=W43pvPkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Danda Paudel</a> on Multi-modal LLMs for Earth Observation.
<!-- Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Jiangxi Normal University in 2022, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZO3KGykAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Aiwen Jiang</a>. -->

<!-- ## Research Interests -->  
**My research interests** [**Keywords**] include but are not limited to Multimodal Learning, Data-centric AI, Foundation Model with its application on Earth Observation [**GeoAI**], towards constructing <span class="highlightone">Foundation Models and Multi-modal LLMs for Earth Observation</span>. I am also dedicated to tackling challenges in Earth sciences through machine learning, with a particular emphasis on solving socially relevant problems, such as advancing sustainable development [**ML4Sustain**][**AI4Earth**].
<!-- - **AI4EO**: Multimodal Learning, Data-centric AI, Foundation Model -->
<!-- - **AI4Earth**: ML4Sustainability -->

**Our Remote Sensing / Earth Observation Foundation Models**: 
- Foundation Detector: [LAE-DINO](https://jianchengpan.space/LAE-website/)   <img class="mini-img"  src="images/papers/lae-dino.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Logo" width="20">
- Generative Foundation Model: [EarthSynth](https://jianchengpan.space/EarthSynth-website/) <img class="mini-img"  src="images/papers/earthsy-logo.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Logo" width="25">

I believe in *<u>earning through skills and achieving through collaboration</u>*. **<font color="#b62be4">If you are interested in my research or have any questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas, please feel free to contact me.</font>**  <span class="highlightone">Email or WeChat[id: **jaychempan**] is OK</span>.

<!-- - **<font color="#b62be4">I am actively seeking internship or co-operation opportunities related to tackling challenges the field of Earth sciences with GeoAI technologies, particularly in sustainable development.</font>**  -->
