About Me
</h2>

Hi, I am Jiancheng Pan (<span style="font-family: 'Ma Shan Zheng', cursive;">潘建成</span>). I am a visiting researcher at <a href="https://insait.ai/">Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology</a> (<img class="mini-img"  src="images/insait-logo.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Logo" width="50"> in Bulgaria), Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski", working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Luc Van Gool</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=W43pvPkAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Danda Paudel</a> on Multi-modal LLMs for Earth Observation.

Previously, I received my Master's degree from the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology in 2025, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XGZ4UZgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Prof. Cong Bai</a>. At the same time, I was a Joint-Program / Visiting Research Student at Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University (2023-2025), under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yH9OkqYAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Xiaomeng Huang</a>.

**My research interests** include Multimodal Learning, Data-centric AI, Foundation Model, Multi-modal LLMs, and with their application on Earth Observation [**GeoAI**]. I am also dedicated to tackling challenges in Earth sciences through machine learning, with an emphasis on advancing sustainable development [<a href="https://github.com/ML4Sustain/">**ML4Sustain**</a>].

**Our Remote Sensing / Earth Observation Foundation Models**: 
- Foundation Detector: [LAE-DINO](https://jianchengpan.space/LAE-website/)   <img class="mini-img"  src="images/papers/lae-dino.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Logo" width="20">
- Generative Foundation Model: [EarthSynth](https://jianchengpan.space/EarthSynth-website/) <img class="mini-img"  src="images/papers/earthsy-logo.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Logo" width="25">
